This is a basic laundry service management system developed using **C++** as part of my **Semester 1 project** for the Diploma in Computer Science program at UiTM.

## 🧼 Features

- Simulates card purchase and top-up for laundry usage
- Handles washer and dryer service selection
- Calculates price based on weight and temperature options
- Displays receipt-like summary for up to 4 services
- Uses `functions`, `loops`, and basic input validation

## 📁 Technologies Used

- C++ (Dev C++ IDE)
- Standard input/output
- Arrays, functions, and conditionals

## 💻 Sample Output

Displays a formatted receipt including:
- Service type (Card/Top-up/Washer/Dryer)
- Detailed selections (weight/temp)
- Price breakdown with total

## 📌 Note

This version may not be the final submission version. It was done as part of coursework to practice basic C++ syntax and logic building.
